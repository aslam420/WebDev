Design Skeletion of Website :
1) DEV 101 -> We will consider this as heading
2) HTML + CSS + JAVASCRIPT -> Nav Bar
Top Part is called as Nav Bar. Isko click kr k hm poori website pe navigate krte hai
Fir aati h CONTENT AREA/DISPLAY AREA jiske andr website ki information display hoti hai
At last aati h FOOTER -> Footer pe humari website k jo v links hote hai wo hote h. Iske andr kuch extra information likhi hoti hai
like copyright logo, extra information, terms and condition & Privacy Policy.

3) Attach Image
